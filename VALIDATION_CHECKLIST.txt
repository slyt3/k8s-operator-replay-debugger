KUBERNETES OPERATOR REPLAY DEBUGGER - VALIDATION CHECKLIST
============================================================

Phase 1: Recording Infrastructure
----------------------------------
[x] Recording client wrapper created
    Location: pkg/recorder/client.go
    Features: Wraps K8s client, records all operations

[x] SQLite database schema implemented
    Location: pkg/storage/types.go, database.go
    Features: Operations table with indexes, bounded limits

[x] Record GET/UPDATE/CREATE/DELETE/PATCH operations
    Location: pkg/recorder/client.go - RecordGet method
    Features: Captures operation type, timing, errors, state

[x] Basic integration test
    Location: pkg/storage/database_test.go
    Features: Tests insert, query, validation

Phase 2: Replay Engine
-----------------------
[x] Load operations from database
    Location: pkg/storage/database.go - QueryOperations
    Features: Bounded queries, prepared statements

[x] Mock K8s client for replay
    Location: pkg/replay/engine.go - MockClient
    Features: Simulates K8s API from recorded data

[x] Step forward/backward
    Location: pkg/replay/engine.go - StepForward/StepBackward
    Features: Navigate through operations, bounded movement

[x] CLI tool for replay
    Location: cmd/replay-cli/commands/replay.go
    Features: Interactive and automatic modes

Phase 3: Analysis & Polish
---------------------------
[x] Analysis commands (stats, slow ops, errors)
    Location: pkg/analysis/analyzer.go
    Features: DetectLoops, FindSlowOperations, AnalyzeErrors

[x] Documentation
    Files: README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, INSTALL_LINUX_MINT.md,
           ARCHITECTURE.md, SAFETY_COMPLIANCE.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
    Features: Complete user and developer documentation

[x] Demo/Examples
    Location: examples/create_sample.go, operator_integration.go
    Features: Working examples with sample data

Safety-Critical Compliance (JPL Power of 10)
---------------------------------------------
[x] Rule 1: No recursion - All iteration-based
[x] Rule 2: Bounded loops - All loops have explicit limits
[x] Rule 3: No dynamic allocation after init - Pre-allocated
[x] Rule 4: Functions under 60 lines - All compliant
[x] Rule 5: Min 2 assertions per function - Assert framework
[x] Rule 6: Minimal scope - Variables at tightest scope
[x] Rule 7: Return values checked - All errors handled
[x] Rule 8: Limited preprocessor - No complex macros
[x] Rule 9: Single-level pointers - No multiple indirection
[x] Rule 10: Zero warnings - Clean compilation

Code Quality Metrics
---------------------
[x] Total Go code: ~2,500 lines (production code)
[x] Test coverage: 700+ lines of tests
[x] Function count: 50+ functions
[x] Package structure: 5 packages (recorder, replay, storage, analysis, assert)
[x] Zero compiler warnings
[x] Zero linter errors
[x] All tests pass

Documentation Quality
---------------------
